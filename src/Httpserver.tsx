                    <h1 className="description">
                    My goal for this program was to design a write a multi-threaded server to transfer files via HTTP connection. Using 
                    curl or simply sending a "GET", "PUT", "APPEND" through netcat command is suitable for communicating with the server.

                    <h1>Insight</h1>
                    <h1 className="description">
                    This program was written completely in C with the help of priority queue to maintain the flow of requests and an 
                    epoll to handle transmission of data that aren't instant. The server works by having a loop that checks for an incoming 
                    request through a conditional mux. The connection then reads from the file descriptor until the Operation, uri, and header 
                    have been received.
                    </h1>
                    <h1>Future</h1>
                    <h1 className="description">
                    Although the current version of the server only handles three commands notably "GET", "PUT", and "APPEND", I plan to 
                    implement "POST" next so that eventually this server can host a variety of functions needed to maintain a system. As 
                    such, the next step would be implement an sql databas where I can organize the collection of files instead of having 
                    them scattered across the root folder. One nice touch would be to implement a simple gui to upload files without needing 
                    to use the terminal.
